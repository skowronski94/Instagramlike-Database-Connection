# Instagramlike-Database-Connection
SQL Server Database on Azure platform connected by LINQ to SQL in C#.

Database shows how Instagram Database could looks like if it has been simplified.
In folder SQL you can find CREATE TABLE and INSERT queries used to create database.
For connection I has used LINQ to SQL classes in Visual Studio.
In file 'Database Diagram.pdf' you can check how LINQ tables structures and relationships look like.
